## Introduction

Python provides several built-in data structures for storing and manipulating data. Two important data structures are sets and dictionaries.

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for performing mathematical operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. They are useful for storing and retrieving data in an efficient manner.

In this repository, we will explore how to use sets and dictionaries in Python.

## Sets

A set is defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements in curly braces (`{}`). For example:

To add an element to a set, you can use the `add()` method:

To remove an element from a set, you can use the `remove()` method:

To check if an element is in a set, you can use the `in` keyword:

To perform mathematical operations on sets, you can use built-in methods such as `union()`, `intersection()`, and `difference()`:


## Dictionaries

A dictionary is defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of key-value pairs in curly braces (`{}`). For example:


To add a key-value pair to a dictionary, you can simply assign a value to a new key:


To remove a key-value pair from a dictionary, you can use the `del` keyword:


To check if a key is in a dictionary, you can use the `in` keyword:


To retrieve the value of a key in a dictionary, you can use the square bracket notation:


## Conclusion

Sets and dictionaries are powerful data structures in Python that can help you solve many programming problems. By understanding how to use sets and dictionaries, you can write more efficient and concise code.
