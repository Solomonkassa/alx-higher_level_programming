# Input/Output in Python

Input and Output (I/O) are essential components of any programming language. In Python, I/O functions are built-in, making it easy to read and write data to files and standard input/output devices. In this readme, we will explore the different types of input and output in Python and how to use them.

## Output

The `print()` function is the primary way to output data in Python. It can be used to print strings, numbers, and other objects. For example:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
print(42)
