# Python Classes

This directory contains Python code demonstrating the use of classes in Python.

## Files

Below is a list of all the files in this directory:

### `0-square.py`

A Python script defining an empty class `Square`.

### `1-square.py`

A Python script defining a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.

### `2-square.py`

A Python script defining a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`, and a public instance method `def area(self)` that returns the area of the square.

### `3-square.py`

A Python script defining a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`, a public instance method `def area(self)` that returns the area of the square, and a public instance method `def my_print(self)` that prints the square to the standard output.

### `4-square.py`

A Python script defining a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`, a public instance method `def area(self)` that returns the area of the square, and a public instance method `def my_print(self)` that prints the square to the standard output using the `print()` function.

### `5-square.py`

A Python script defining a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`, a public instance method `def area(self)` that returns the area of the square, a public instance method `def my_print(self)` that prints the square to the standard output using the `print()` function, and a setter and getter for the `size` attribute.

### `6-square.py`

A Python script defining a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`, a public instance method `def area(self)` that returns the area of the square, a public instance method `def my_print(self)` that prints the square to the standard output using the `print()` function, a setter and getter for the `size` attribute, and a class method `def bigger_or_equal(cls, square_a, square_b)` that returns the bigger of two squares.

## Usage

To use any of the classes defined in these files, import them into your Python code and create instances of the class. For example:
