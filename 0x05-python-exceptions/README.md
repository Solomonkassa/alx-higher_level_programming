# Python Exceptions

Python exceptions are a way of handling errors that may occur during program execution. An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as incorrect input, network errors, or file access errors.

Python provides a mechanism for catching and handling exceptions. This mechanism is called an "exception handler" and it allows the program to recover from an error and continue execution. 

## Types of Exceptions

Python has a number of built-in exceptions that can be raised during program execution. Some of the most common built-in exceptions include:

- `ValueError`: raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.
- `TypeError`: raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
- `NameError`: raised when a local or global name is not found.
- `IndexError`: raised when an index is out of range.
- `KeyError`: raised when a dictionary key is not found.
- `FileNotFoundError`: raised when a file or directory cannot be found.

## Handling Exceptions

To handle exceptions in Python, you can use a `try`/`except` statement. The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception, while the `except` block contains the code that should be executed if an exception is raised. Here is an example:

```python
try:
    # code that might raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # code to handle the exception
try:
    # code that might raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # code to handle the exception
else:
    # code to execute if no exception is raised
finally:
    # code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not
The else clause is executed if no exception is raised, while the finally clause is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.
Raising Exceptions

In addition to catching exceptions, you can also raise exceptions yourself using the raise statement. Here is an example:

python

if x < 0:
    raise ValueError("x cannot be negative")

In this example, the ValueError exception is raised if x is negative.

## Conclusion

Python exceptions are a powerful mechanism for handling errors and ensuring that your program runs smoothly. By using try/except statements, you can catch and handle exceptions that may occur during program execution. By raising exceptions yourself, you can ensure that your code is robust and handles unexpected situations gracefully.
