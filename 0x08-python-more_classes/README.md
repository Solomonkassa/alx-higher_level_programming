# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description
This project is focused on learning more about classes and objects in Python.

## Files
- **0-rectangle.py:** An empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- **1-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width and height.
- **2-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width, height, and can calculate its area and perimeter.
- **3-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width, height, and can calculate its area and perimeter. It also adds a string representation of the rectangle.
- **4-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width, height, and can calculate its area and perimeter. It also adds a string representation of the rectangle and a method that prints the rectangle using the `#` character.
- **5-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width, height, and can calculate its area and perimeter. It also adds a string representation of the rectangle and a method that prints the rectangle using the `#` character. It also has a method to delete the rectangle instance.
- **6-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width, height, and can calculate its area and perimeter. It also adds a string representation of the rectangle and a method that prints the rectangle using the `#` character. It also has static methods to compare rectangles by area and class methods to change the rectangle's dimensions based on a factor.
- **7-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width, height, and can calculate its area and perimeter. It also adds a string representation of the rectangle and a method that prints the rectangle using the `#` character. It also has static methods to compare rectangles by area and class methods to change the rectangle's dimensions based on a factor. It also adds a public class attribute `number_of_instances` to keep track of the number of instances created.
- **8-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width, height, and can calculate its area and perimeter. It also adds a string representation of the rectangle and a method that prints the rectangle using the `#` character. It also has static methods to compare rectangles by area and class methods to change the rectangle's dimensions based on a factor. It also adds public class attributes `number_of_instances` and `print_symbol`.
- **9-rectangle.py:** A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width, height, and can calculate its area and perimeter. It also adds a string representation of the rectangle and a method that prints the rectangle using the `#` character. It also has static methods to compare rectangles by area and class methods to change the rectangle's dimensions based on a factor. It also adds public class attributes `number_of_instances` and `print_symbol`. It also adds a method to create a new rectangle from its string representation.
