# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
This is a project on data structures in Python. It covers the following topics:
- Lists and their usage
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Common methods of lists and how to use them
- Using lists as stacks and queues
- List comprehensions and how to use them
- Tuples and their usage
- When to use tuples versus lists
- Sequence, tuple packing, and sequence unpacking
- The del statement and how to use it

- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the del statement and how to use it

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### C
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Tasks
### [0. Print a list of integers](./0-print_list_integer.py)
A function that prints all integers of a list.

### [1. Secure access to an element in a list](./1-element_at.py)
A function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

### [2. Replace element](./2-replace_in_list.py)
A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.

### [3. Print a list of integers...in reverse!](./3-print_reversed_list_integer.py)
A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

### [4. Replace in a copy](./4-new_in_list.py)
A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

### [5. Can you C me now?](./5-no_c.py)
A function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.

### [6. Lists of lists = Matrix
Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

### Task 7: Tuples addition
Write a function that adds 2 tuples.

### Task 8: More returns!
Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

### Task 9: Find the max
Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

### Task 10: Only by 2
Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

### Task 11: Delete at
Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

### Task 12: Switch
Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b.

### Task 13: Linked list palindrome
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

### Conclusion

This project covered the fundamentals of Lists and Tuples in Python. It is important to understand the differences between the two and their respective use cases. We also learned about List comprehensions and Tuple packing and sequence unpacking. Finally, we covered the use of the del statement.
