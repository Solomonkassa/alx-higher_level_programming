# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project is part of the Alx School curriculum and it's focused on the basics of Python programming. The topics covered in this project are conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Learning Objectives

- What is the `if` statement and how to use it
- What is the `if ... else` statement and how to use it
- What is the `break` and `continue` statements and how to use them
- What is a `for` loop and how to use it
- What is a `while` loop and how to use it
- What is a `function` and how to define one
- What is a `return` statement and how to use it

## Requirements

- All the files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All the code use the PEP 8 style (version 2.7.*)
- The first line of all the files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`

## Projects

### 0-positive_or_negative.py

A program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and then determines if the number is positive, negative, or zero. 

### 1-last_digit.py

A program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and then determines if the last digit of the number is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 but not 0.

### 2-print_alphabet.py

A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 3-print_alphabt.py

A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line except for the letters `q` and `e`.

### 4-print_hexa.py

A program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

### 5-print_comb2.py

A program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 separated by `,`, followed by a space and all numbers have to be printed in ascending order, with two digits.

### 6-print_comb3.py

A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits separated by `,` and a space in ascending order.

### 7-islower.py

A function that checks for lowercase character.

### 8-uppercase.py

A function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

### 9-print_last_digit.py

A function that prints the last digit of a number.

### 10-add.py

A function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11-pow.py

A function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

### 12-fizzbuzz.py

A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

### 13-insert_number.c, lists.h

A function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
