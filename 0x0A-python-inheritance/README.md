## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School ALX Software Engineering curriculum. In this project, we explore the concept of inheritance in Python. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), where a new class is created by inheriting properties and characteristics from an existing class. 

Inheritance allows us to create a hierarchical relationship between classes, where one class is a "subclass" of another class, which is known as the "superclass". The subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass, and can also add new attributes and methods or modify existing ones. This allows us to reuse code and avoid redundancy in our programs.

This project includes several Python scripts that demonstrate how to use inheritance in Python. Each script contains a class hierarchy, where the subclass inherits from the superclass and adds new functionality.

## Files

The following files are included in this project:

- `0-lookup.py`: a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.
- `1-my_list.py`: a class that inherits from the built-in `list` class and adds a new method to print the list in ascending order.
- `2-is_same_class.py`: a function that checks if an object is an instance of a specified class.
- `3-is_kind_of_class.py`: a function that checks if an object is an instance of a specified class or a subclass of that class.
- `4-inherits_from.py`: a function that checks if an object is a subclass of a specified class.
- `5-base_geometry.py`: an empty class that will be the superclass for other classes in this project.
- `6-base_geometry.py`: a class that inherits from `5-base_geometry.py` and adds a method to raise an exception if called.
- `7-base_geometry.py`: a class that inherits from `6-base_geometry.py` and adds methods to validate the width and height of a rectangle.
- `8-rectangle.py`: a class that inherits from `7-base_geometry.py` and represents a rectangle.
- `9-rectangle.py`: a class that inherits from `8-rectangle.py` and adds a method to calculate the area of the rectangle.
- `10-square.py`: a class that inherits from `9-rectangle.py` and represents a square.
- `11-square.py`: a class that inherits from `10-square.py` and overrides the `__str__` method to print a custom message.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. To run the scripts, simply use the following command in your terminal:


Replace `<filename>` with the name of the script you want to run.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using Python 3.8.5.
